      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to believe these words but I pushed Sidekiq&amp;rsquo;s first commit on Jan 16th, 2012. Ten years ago. The public announcement. One month later. One quarter later.
Some context for those new to this blog: Sidekiq is the most popular background job system for the Ruby programming language. Every application has tasks which are important: send an email, charge a credit card, reserve inventory for an order, synchronize some data to a 3rd party service, etc.</description>

      <title>What&#39;s New in Sidekiq 6.3</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce the general availability of Sidekiq 6.3 here at Rubyconf 2021! Since Sidekiq 6.2 in March we&amp;rsquo;ve passed 110 million downloads on Rubygems.org and added a number of nice new features. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in!
Sidekiq::Job One consistent issue in communication with the Sidekiq community is the nebulous term worker. Are you talking about a process? A thread? A type of job? Vagueness breeds confusion and frustration. I encourage developers to stop using the term worker and use include Sidekiq::Job in your job classes.</description>

      <title>On Multi-Platform Docker images</title>

      <description>Until recently, Faktory only supported the x86_64 platform. With the rise of the Apple Silicon chip and AWS Graviton, it was obvious that I would need to roll out ARM64 support soon. This week I spent several days fighting Docker&amp;rsquo;s support for multi-platform images and wanted to document what I learned.
Faktory OSS The Faktory OSS build was relatively straightforward, with three steps for each platform:
Build the ./faktory binary on the host.</description>

      <title>Using Tags with Sidekiq Jobs</title>

      <description>A customer recently opened issue to point out a bug in Sidekiq&amp;rsquo;s tag filtering support and I realized: I haven&amp;rsquo;t told people that tags exist. Oops. Here is your notification. 😁
Sidekiq 6.0.1 added support for per-job tags. Tags are an Array of Strings within the job payload. Maybe you want to tag the sports related to a given job:
class SomeWorker include Sidekiq::Worker sidekiq_options tags: [&amp;#39;alpha&amp;#39;] There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of ideas for job tagging:</description>

      <title>A Tour of the Sidekiq API</title>

      <description>Sidekiq provides an underappreciated but powerful tool for all users: the Sidekiq API. The API gives comprehensive and idiomatic access to Sidekiq&amp;rsquo;s underlying real-time job and queue data within Redis.
The Glossary To explore the API, first it helps to understand the basic entities in Sidekiq&amp;rsquo;s universe:
A job is a unit of work in your Ruby application A queue is a list of jobs which are ready to execute right now A process is a Sidekiq process with one or more threads for executing jobs.</description>

      <description>Faktory is my background job server for use with any programming language. It brings the nice patterns and features available in Sidekiq to the rest of the world. Using Go, Python, JavaScript, Elixir, or other languages? Give Faktory a shot!
Today I&amp;rsquo;ve released Faktory, Faktory Pro and Faktory Enterprise 1.5.0. What&amp;rsquo;s new?
Pause / Resume The OSS version of Faktory now allows you to Pause and Resume processing for a queue.</description>

      <title>Grouping Events for Later Processing</title>

      <description>A customer recently wondered how they could handle aggregate events in Sidekiq. They don&amp;rsquo;t want one background job per event but rather a background job to handle the last N events.
Let&amp;rsquo;s pretend we work for an ecommerce vendor and we want to track product clicks: User A clicks on Product B. This is a naive way to show interest in a product or category; we want to store this data for long-term data mining purposes.</description>

      <title>Running Ruby on RISC-V</title>

      <description>With the release of the new arm64 architecture M1 Macbooks, I started wondering about x86 alternatives and came across RISC-V. RISC-V is an open source ISA (the set of instructions documented by a CPU) which does not cost anything to use. Anyone can take the ISA, build a chip which implements the ISA and then any software compiled for RISC-V will run on that chip. Several generations of RISC ISAs were created at UC Berkeley in the 1980s; RISC-V denotes their fifth generation ISA.</description>

      <title>The Leaky Bucket rate limiter</title>
      <link>https://www.mikeperham.com/2020/11/09/the-leaky-bucket-rate-limiter/</link>

      <guid>https://www.mikeperham.com/2020/11/09/the-leaky-bucket-rate-limiter/</guid>
      <description>A few months ago, a customer asked if I could supply a &amp;ldquo;leaky bucket&amp;rdquo; rate limiter as part of Sidekiq Enterprise&amp;rsquo;s rate limiter suite. It took me a while to find the time and energy to work on it (my need to mentally escape the 2020 election eventually did the trick).
I went into this process knowing the basics of the leaky bucket algorithm but with no idea how to implement it.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Your work doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if no one knows about it&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; some marketing genius
COVID and wildfires have made this year hellish and really difficult to focus. I sympathize with all of my fellow engineers trying to maintain systems and improve apps while dealing with our rapidly changing society. Be kind to each other. ❤️
Let&amp;rsquo;s distract ourselves with a Sidekiq family update.
