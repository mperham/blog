<p>Ruby is great for programmers: you can download the source for so many different libraries to solve many different problems.
But there&rsquo;s a dark side: there&rsquo;s no incentive for the library author to help or support you as a user.
So many open source projects become ghost towns over the course of a year or two due to ongoing support and time commitments.
If you&rsquo;re building a long-term business with these tools, it&rsquo;s in your best interests to ensure they remain
supported with a steady flow of features and bug fixes for years to come.</p>
<p>Many developers are trying to find a happy medium between the Open Source &ldquo;give it all away&rdquo; approach
and the traditional commercial software approach &ldquo;talk to this sales guy to get a quote&rdquo; by selling Open Source-based
products.  Steady income makes the ongoing time commitment so much easier to handle.</p>
<p>Note that I&rsquo;m focused on bootstrapped or &ldquo;indie&rdquo; developers selling Ruby-related <strong>products</strong> and ignoring VC-backed companies or
SaaSes.  Indie developers don&rsquo;t have the benefit of big marketing budgets or sales staff.
They might blog, go to conferences and/or give away swag but they often don&rsquo;t get much public attention.
Let&rsquo;s change that!</p>
<h2 id="class-of-2015">Class of 2015</h2>
<p>Without further ado, here&rsquo;s the list I came up.  Thanks to my Twitter followers for many suggestions!</p>
<p><strong>Dresssed</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://dresssed.com/themes/gimlet">Dresssed</a> sells premium site templates for Rails.  Get a beautiful template for
your new site with lots of form variants, error pages, SASS integration, responsive design, etc already built.</p>
<p><strong>GitLab</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/">GitLab</a> offers an open source alternative to GitHub Enterprise.  If you
need to self-host your own source code repositories, this is one way to do it.  They offer GitLab Enterprise
with extra features and support.</p>
<p><strong>Passenger</strong></p>
<p>Passenger is the canonical commercial/OSS hybrid product and Phusion does a fantastic job pushing the envelope in features
and performance.  (I&rsquo;m happy to admit I borrowed several of their ideas when bootstrapping my own project.)
They sell <a href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com/enterprise">Passenger Enterprise</a>: an upgrade of their free
Passenger OSS library with additional features and support.  If you have a business running on Rails,
this should be your first purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Payola</strong></p>
<p>Pete Keen has carved out a niche as the expert on Rails + Stripe.  If you need top-notch Stripe integration,
Payola is your solution.  His commercial variant, <a href="https://www.payola.io/pro">Payola Pro</a>, adds a number
of additional features and a support contract.</p>
<p><strong>RailsKits</strong></p>
<p>RailsKits offers Rails app templates with common functionality already built-in.  Their <a href="https://railskits.com/saas/">SaaS kit</a>
gives you a full Rails 4.1 app skeleton with monthly subscriptions, pricing tiers and multi-tenant database storage pre-built
for one low price; sounds awesome!</p>
<p><strong>RailsLTS</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://railslts.com/">RailsLTS</a> offers long-term support for very popular Rails versions, backporting critical security fixes to
older Rails versions which aren&rsquo;t maintained anymore by Rails Core.  They&rsquo;ve released 12 versions of
2.3.18 so far and will be adding Rails 3.2 support soon.</p>
<p><strong>RubyMotion</strong></p>
<p>How awesome is <a href="http://www.rubymotion.com/buy/">RubyMotion</a>?  Write native iOS applications with Ruby!  Not technically a Ruby product
since it&rsquo;s all Mac/iOS native, but it&rsquo;s focused on making iOS development for us Rubyists as easy as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Sidekiq</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to be part of this list too!  <a href="http://sidekiq.org/">Sidekiq Pro</a> extends Sidekiq with more features and a support contract.
If you want to build a scalable Ruby website for the long-term, use Passenger Enterprise for your app server and Sidekiq Pro for
processing background jobs.  Since its launch three years ago, Sidekiq has grown from a side project to my full-time job.</p>
<p><strong>TwoFactorAuth</strong></p>
<p>Peter Harkins built <a href="https://www.twofactorauth.io/">TwoFactorAuth</a>, a gem which adds U2F key fob (e.g. Yubikey) support to your Rails app.  It&rsquo;s AGPL
licensed for free, you must pay for commercial usage.  I love OSS projects which have the courage to use GNU + commercial licensing: everything is out
in the open but the author built something valuable, businesses need to pay for that value and the AGPL enforces that.  Makes for a dead simple way
to allow free trials while ensuring sales with no effort on the developer&rsquo;s part.  When you think about all the government, health care and financial
apps which can be built in Rails and need robust authentication, I bet there&rsquo;s a nice niche market for Peter to capture here!</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>That&rsquo;s only nine - I wish there were more!  If I missed anyone, please let me know.</p>
