Damon Clinkscales, of Austin on Rails fame, has created a one-day workshop to take your Rails skills from 0-60 in 8 hours. While this might be abysmally slow for a car, it&#8217;s a rocket sled for software engineering! I&#8217;ll be there, teaching about ActiveRecord and how to bend the database to your will. If you or someone you know is looking to kickstart their Rails skills, check it out. Seating is extremely limited (10 seats total!) so get it while it&#8217;s hot.

[Rails Bootup, Austin TX, August 2nd][1]
