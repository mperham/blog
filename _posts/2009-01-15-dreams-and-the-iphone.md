This article spurred me in a completely unexpected technical direction over the winter break: [Massive Christmas iPod Touch Sales Boost App Store Downloads][1]. Two facts struck me:

*   An application which makes farting sounds was selling 40,000 units/day.
*   I&#8217;ve had a secret dream for a year&#8230;

My dream? To make a $5 keychain sold at the checkout stand in Wal-Mart which just plays gag sound effects. The keychain&#8217;s user interface is dead simple: three buttons, each of which plays a sound. It may sound ridiculous but *I do this all the time in real life*. I tell a joke and make a rimshot noise. Or I tell a joke, it bombs and I make the sound of crickets. A keychain is something you always have in your pocket, ready at a moment&#8217;s notice (at least the fellas do, sorry ladies!).

The hard part about this is finding someone to design, build and stock a keychain in tens of thousands of units. The investment needed could easily go into tens of thousands of dollars. What I realized is that cell phones are just as easily accessible and the iPhone makes this possible to do all in software. It&#8217;s not quite the perfect solution but the advantages for me far outweigh the drawbacks.

Thus, I built [Zinger][2], my own take on the perfect comedy assistant. The UI is as fast and simple as possible. You touch the icon, it presents you with three big buttons; you really cannot get any simpler. And simplicity is what you are buying here: the more buttons you have to push to get to the sound effect, the less useful the app is in general, and when you are looking for a zany sound effect, timing is everything.

It may not outsell iFart but I hope it makes people laugh just as much. Enjoy!
