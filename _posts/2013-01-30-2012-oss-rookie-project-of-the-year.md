Each year, Black Duck Software picks their top 10 new open source projects created that year. For 2012, [Sidekiq][1] has been selected one of those [10 OSS rookie projects][2]! How cool is that?

The ranking is based on activity, contributors, pull requests and other factors so I literally could not have done this without those who used Sidekiq, sent PRs and entered issues. Thank you to Black Duck and all my users for using and believing in Sidekiq; I hope to make 2013 just as amazing!
