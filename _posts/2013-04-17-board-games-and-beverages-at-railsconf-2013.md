You are invited to a whimsical evening of merriment and gamesmanship!

What: Board Games and Beverages  
Where: [Skyroom Lounge][1], top of Red Lion Hotel, across the street from Railsconf  
When: Tuesday, 4/30 7-11pm

The Skyroom has a great view of Portland so try to get there before sundown. We should have enough games for everyone but bring your favorite if you&#8217;d like. They have food if you need a late dinner. They have room for 250 so I&#8217;m hoping we&#8217;ll have plenty of room for everyone.

If you&#8217;re in, please comment to RSVP!
