Gregg and Nathaniel (both of whom are notorious Gowalla cheats, which I would never do, no sir) chat a bit about Phat in the [latest episode of Ruby5][1].

The Changelog crew also gave [their take on Phat][2] in a recent posting.

I&#8217;ve spent 100s of hours working on the technology behind Phat over the last six months. If you think it&#8217;s awesome, please consider [recommending me on Working with Rails][3]. I&#8217;m not asking for money, just an electronic thumbs up from my fellow Ruby community members. Thanks!
