<p>Andr√© Arko (@indirect, Bundler), Erik Michaels-Ober (@sferik, t/rails_admin/multi_json) and myself had a hangout this afternoon to talk about our struggles as Open Source developers and project leads. Here&rsquo;s my notes, as I recollect:</p>
<p>Erik:</p>
<p>Enjoys working on his twitter gem, doesn&rsquo;t enjoy rails_admin anymore. There&rsquo;s a fair amount of design/theme work in rails_admin that he&rsquo;s not good at and really needs to be abstracted out but would require a lot more time than he wants to invest. Features of rails_admin were merged in but made it hard to maintain (e.g. mongodb support because he doesn&rsquo;t use Mongo personally). Thought for a while how to make rails_admin into a full time job.</p>
<p>Andr√©:</p>
<p>Bundler has tried to bring new people into the project where possible. Managing these people and getting them to commit to work is difficult when you don&rsquo;t have any real authority over them. Ruby Central has given him a grant to work on Rubygems and Bundler.</p>
<p>Mike:</p>
<p>I wanted Sidekiq to be better than the status quo but was scared to death of the amount of time needed to support it over the next 5 years if it took off. I had two strategies from the start:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be very picky about the features I accept and how they&rsquo;re implemented</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s my project so I have to support every line of code in it. Features that I know will cause support issues are redesigned or denied. For example, I won&rsquo;t allow any features that require locking or distributed coordination. This keeps the codebase enjoyable.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Offer users a way to support the project financially</li>
</ol>
<p>OSS is hard work, given away for free. I had no real desire to start a services/consulting company as I enjoy my day job. Selling a &ldquo;support plan&rdquo; is a disincentive to product quality: if your product is easy to use and well documented, you suffer financially. My initial plan to sell commercial licenses brought in beer money, no more. I decided to build a <a href="http://sidekiq.org/">value-added product</a> on top of the OSS core (who else does this?) which has been very successful so far.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>Projects can differ radically in how to sustain them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning can be a huge personal incentive to start and implement a project but doesn&rsquo;t necessarily help support the project over months and years.</li>
<li>Help from others and thanks can go a long way. Managing volunteers has its own challenges.</li>
<li>Keep the codebase clean and enjoyable to work on, refactoring to improve your enjoyment of the code can be a great idea. Prune features which are support hotspots.</li>
<li>If you want to earn anything more than beer money for your efforts, explicitly consider a business model appropriate to you and your project.</li>
</ul>
