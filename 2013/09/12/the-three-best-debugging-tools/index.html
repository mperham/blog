<p><strong>1. Your Coworker</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happened to me over and over: I&rsquo;ll spend hours trying to track down a problem. In frustration, I&rsquo;ll ask a coworker to look at the code and frequently they will point out the problem in seconds. It&rsquo;s called situational blindness and it means that you will often overlook the bug right in front of your eyes because you&rsquo;ve looked at it so much, your mind has started to ignore it.</p>
<p>Your coworker has another valuable trait: they are different than you. They think differently and have a different set of knowledge. A hard bug for you to find might be easy for them. Next time you&rsquo;re frustrated, call over a coworker and see what happens.</p>
<p><strong>2. Your Creative Side</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happened to me over and over: I&rsquo;ll build something with a flaw that doesn&rsquo;t quite work right. I&rsquo;ll go to sleep frustrated and wake up the next morning knowing exactly what the problem is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well known that we think in two different manners: creatively and logically. When focused on details (such as debugging a problem), we&rsquo;re 100% logical as we jump from thought A to B to C. But it&rsquo;s your creative side that can jump from thought A to thought Z via intuition. Like your coworker, your creative brain thinks differently from your logical brain. By going to sleep, you&rsquo;re calling over that &ldquo;creative coworker&rdquo; and asking for help.</p>
<p><strong>3. Your Mental Model of the System</strong></p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know the software tools and APIs you are using to solve problems really well, you&rsquo;ll find yourself endlessly debugging. When learning a system like Ruby on Rails for the first few years, debugging is often really just learning how the system works. Software is insanely complex and <strong>every level of the stack is insanely complex</strong>. Abstractions hide much of the complexity and understanding those abstractions well allows you to fit it all within your head.</p>
<p>Malcom Gladwell&rsquo;s maxim that expertise comes with 10,000 hours of practice holds here too. After 5 years of full-time experience (40hrs/wk * 50 wk/yr * 5), you&rsquo;ll have a very strong understanding of your system of choice. That knowledge is very valuable.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: read the documentation for a library that you are going to use, implement your first attempt at using that library, <strong>and then read the documentation again</strong>. The first time will give you an overview and things to look for but frequently you won&rsquo;t comprehend certain aspects due to your inexperience with the library. You almost certainly will comprehend more when you read it the second time.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>All of these things have one thing in common: thought. Debugging is thinking through the execution of code <strong>in your head</strong>. By improving your knowledge and looking at the problem from different angles, you can much more effectively debug those hard problems that can be so frustrating.</p>
