<h1>RDoc Markup</h1> 
<p> 
Comment blocks can be written fairly naturally.
</p> 
<p> 
Paragraphs are lines that share the left margin. Text indented past this
margin are formatted verbatim.
</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Lists are typed as indented paragraphs with:
 
<ul> 
<li>a '*' or '-' (for bullet lists)
 
</li> 
<li>a digit followed by a period for numbered lists
 
</li> 
</ul> 
<p> 
For example, the input that produced the above paragraph looked like
</p> 
```
 
    1. Lists are typed as indented
       paragraphs with:
       * a '*' or '-' (for bullet lists)
       * a digit followed by a period for
         numbered lists
``` 
</li> 
<li>Labeled lists (sometimes called description lists) are typed using square
brackets for the label.
 
```
 
   [cat]   small domestic animal
   [+cat+] command to copy standard input
``` 
</li> 
<li>Labeled lists may also be produced by putting a double colon after the
label. This sets the result in tabular form, so the descriptions all line
up. This was used to create the 'author' block at the bottom of this
description.
 
```
 
   cat::   small domestic animal
   +cat+:: command to copy standard input
``` 
<p> 
For both kinds of labeled lists, if the body text starts on the same line
as the label, then the start of that text determines the block indent for
the rest of the body. The text may also start on the line following the
label, indented from the start of the label. This is often preferable if
the label is long. Both the following are valid labeled list entries:
</p> 
```
 
   &lt;tt&gt;--output&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;i&gt;name [, name]&lt;/i&gt;::
       specify the name of one or more output files. If multiple
       files are present, the first is used as the index.
 
   &lt;tt&gt;--quiet:&lt;/tt&gt;:: do not output the names, sizes, byte counts,
                       index areas, or bit ratios of units as
                       they are processed.
``` 
</li> 
<li>Headings are entered using equals signs
 
```
 
   = Level One Heading
   == Level Two Heading
``` 
<p> 
and so on
</p> 
</li> 
<li>Rules (horizontal lines) are entered using three or more hyphens.
 
</li> 
<li>Non-verbatim text can be marked up:
 
<table> 
<tr><td valign="top"><em>italic</em>:</td><td><em>word</em> or &lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;
 
</td></tr> 
<tr><td valign="top"><b>bold</b>:</td><td><b>word</b> or &lt;b&gt;text&lt;/b&gt;
 
</td></tr> 
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>typewriter</tt>:</td><td><tt>word</tt> or &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt;
 
</td></tr> 
</table> 
<p> 
The first form only words around 'words', where a word is a sequence of
upper and lower case letters and underscores. Putting a backslash before
inline markup stops it being interpreted, which is how I created the table
above:
</p> 
```
 
  _italic_::     \_word_ or \&lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;
  *bold*::       \*word* or \&lt;b&gt;text&lt;/b&gt;
  +typewriter+:: \+word+ or \&lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt;
``` 
</li> 
<li>Names of classes, source files, and any method names containing an
underscore or preceded by a hash character are automatically hyperlinked
from comment text to their description.
 
</li> 
<li>Hyperlinks to the web starting http:, mailto:, ftp:, or www. are
recognized. An HTTP url that references an external image file is converted
into an inline &lt;IMG..&gt;. Hyperlinks starting 'link:' are assumed to
refer to local files whose path is relative to the --op directory.
 
<p> 
Hyperlinks can also be of the form <tt>label</tt>[url], in which case the
label is used in the displayed text, and <tt>url</tt> is used as the
target.
</p> 
</li> 
<li>Method parameter lists are extracted and displayed with the method
description. If a method calls <tt>yield</tt>, then the parameters passed
to yield will also be displayed:
 
```
 
   def fred
     ...
     yield line, address
``` 
<p> 
This will get documented as
</p> 
```
 
   fred() { |line, address| ... }
``` 
<p> 
You can override this using a comment containing ':yields: ...' immediately
after the method definition
</p> 
```
 
   def fred      # :yields: index, position
     ...
     yield line, address
``` 
<p> 
which will get documented as
</p> 
```
 
    fred() { |index, position| ... }
``` 
</li> 
<li>':yields:' is an example of a documentation modifier. These appear
immediately after the start of the document element they are modifying.
Other modifiers include
 
<dl> 
<dt><tt>:nodoc:</tt><em>[all]</em></dt><dd>don't include this element in the documentation. For classes and modules,
methods, aliases, and attributes directly within the affected class will
also be omitted. By default, though, modules and classes within that class
of module <em>will</em> be documented. This is turned off by adding the
<tt>all</tt> modifier.
 
```
 
     module SM  #:nodoc:
       class Input
       end
     end
     module Markup #:nodoc: all
       class Output
       end
     end
``` 
<p> 
In the above code, only class <tt>SM::Input</tt> will be documented.
</p> 
</dd> 
<dt><tt>:doc:</tt></dt><dd>force a method to be documented even if it wouldn't otherwise be. Useful
is, for example, you want to include documentation of a particular private
method.
 
</dd> 
<dt><tt>:notnew:</tt></dt><dd>only applicable to the <tt>initialize</tt> instance method. Normally <a
href="../classes/RDoc.html">RDoc</a> assumes that the documentation and
parameters for <a href="../classes/Exception.html#M000022">initialize</a> 
are actually for the ::new method, and so fakes out a ::new for the class.
THe :notnew: modifier stops this. Remember that <a
href="../classes/Exception.html#M000022">initialize</a> is protected, so
you won't see the documentation unless you use the -a command line option.
 
</dd> 
</dl> 
</li> 
<li><a href="../classes/RDoc.html">RDoc</a> stops processing comments if it
finds a comment line containing '<tt>#--</tt>'. This can be used to
separate external from internal comments, or to stop a comment being
associated with a method, class, or module. Commenting can be turned back
on with a line that starts '<tt>#++</tt>'.
 
```
 
    # Extract the age and calculate the
    # date-of-birth.
    #--
    # FIXME: fails if the birthday falls on
    # February 29th
    #++
    # The DOB is returned as a Time object.
 
    def get_dob(person)
       ...
``` 
</li> 
<li>Comment blocks can contain other directives:
 
<dl> 
<dt><tt>:include:</tt><em>filename</em></dt><dd>include the contents of the named file at this point. The file will be
searched for in the directories listed by the <tt>--include</tt> option, or
in the current directory by default. The contents of the file will be
shifted to have the same indentation as the ':' at the start of the
:include: directive.
 
</dd> 
<dt><tt>:title:</tt><em>text</em></dt><dd>Sets the title for the document. Equivalent to the --title command line
parameter. (The command line parameter overrides any :title: directive in
the source).
 
</dd> 
<dt><tt>:main:</tt><em>name</em></dt><dd>Equivalent to the --main command line parameter.
 
</dd> 
</dl> 
</li>
