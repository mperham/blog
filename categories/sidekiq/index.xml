      <title>The Path to Full-time Open Source</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two years ago today I released &lt;a href=&#34;http://sidekiq.org/&#34;&gt;Sidekiq Pro&lt;/a&gt;, my commercial extension&lt;/a&gt; to Sidekiq, as an experiment to see if I could make OSS development financially viable for individual developers. I had no idea if anyone would trust me and buy it. Can you think of anyone else selling a Rubygem?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the Sidekiq 3.0 release, I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly chipping away at some new features in &lt;a href=&#34;http://sidekiq.org/&#34;&gt;Sidekiq Pro&lt;/a&gt;. What&amp;rsquo;s new and upcoming?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bounded Libraries</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been noticing a theme in certain Rubygems recently that I like: opinionated designs which explicitly don&amp;rsquo;t allow the user to do certain things. I call these &lt;strong&gt;bounded libraries&lt;/strong&gt; because they draw a functional boundary and won&amp;rsquo;t go beyond that point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sidekiq 3.0!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After tons of work on &lt;a href=&#34;http://sidekiq.org&#34;&gt;Sidekiq&lt;/a&gt; 2.x for the last 18 months, I decided it was time for some deeper refactoring and cleanup necessitating a major version bump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidekiq 3.0 is the result of three months of hacking, cleanup and community suggestions. There&amp;rsquo;s an huge amount of stuff in here so hang on to your hats&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Advanced Sidekiq: Host-specific Queues</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first in a series of posts offering neat tricks to get the most out of Sidekiq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently we rewrote part of The Clymb to process images asynchronously using Sidekiq. The user uploads the image file, it is saved to disk and a job created to process the file. Almost immediately we saw a bunch of retries with the error &amp;ldquo;Unable to find file xyz.jpg&amp;rdquo;. We just uploaded the file, how could it not be there?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to make $100k in OSS by working hard</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;http://sidekiq.org&#34;&gt;Sidekiq&lt;/a&gt; project isn&amp;rsquo;t just about building the best background processing framework for Ruby, it&amp;rsquo;s also a venue for me to experiment with ways to make open source software financially sustainable for the developers who work on it hundreds of hours each year (e.g. me). Let&amp;rsquo;s review.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lua and Sidekiq Pro</title>
      <link>https://www.mikeperham.com/2013/08/10/lua-and-sidekiq-pro/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve started working with Redis 2.6&amp;rsquo;s embedded Lua support to power new features for Sidekiq Pro. I think there&amp;rsquo;s a rich vein of functionality to be tapped here for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Server-side execution = performance&lt;/strong&gt; O(n) algorithms perform much better when you don&amp;rsquo;t have network latency. For example, Sidekiq Pro 1.2 adds a &lt;code&gt;Sidekiq::Queue#delete_job&lt;/code&gt; API which scans a queue and deletes the job with the given JID. Previously this required network round trips and so performed poorly, even when using paging. With a queue size of 10,000 jobs, my benchmark deleting 200 random jobs with the Lua version is 15x faster (1.5sec vs 20sec).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atomic execution&lt;/strong&gt; Lua operations execute atomically in Redis so you can add complex logic to mutate data within Redis without the need for locks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a caveat of course: Redis is single-threaded so executing a user-defined Lua script can add significant latency to other Redis operations if you aren&amp;rsquo;t careful with performance. O(n^2) algorithms are definitely a no-no and minimizing O(n) algorithms is still a good idea if you want your Redis server to continue to perform well. Nevertheless I think Lua has real potential for developing some cool new features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce the winner of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://sidekiq.org/&#34;&gt;Sidekiq Pro&lt;/a&gt; 1.0 license giveaway is Libin Pan, whose company already uses Sidekiq pretty heavily, having run &lt;strong&gt;billions&lt;/strong&gt; of jobs through Sidekiq in the last year. Let&amp;rsquo;s hear his story:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sidekiq Pro reaches 1.0!</title>
      <link>https://www.mikeperham.com/2013/05/07/sidekiq-pro-reaches-1-0/</link>

      <guid>https://www.mikeperham.com/2013/05/07/sidekiq-pro-reaches-1-0/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I announced &lt;a href=&#34;http://sidekiq.org/&#34;&gt;Sidekiq Pro&lt;/a&gt; seven months ago and since then I&amp;rsquo;ve released 15 versions with both minor bugfixes and major new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I decided to pull the trigger and call it 1.0! I&amp;rsquo;ve moved the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/Pro-Changes.md&#34;&gt;Sidekiq Pro changelog&lt;/a&gt; to the sidekiq repo for better visibility for all Sidekiq users. &lt;a href=&#34;https://watsi.org/&#34;&gt;Watsi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://litmus.com/&#34;&gt;Litmus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://customer.io/&#34;&gt;Customer.io&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://travis-ci.org/&#34;&gt;Travis-CI&lt;/a&gt; are just a few of the companies that have upgraded to Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To celebrate the 1.0 release, I&amp;rsquo;m giving away one free license to an existing Sidekiq user!&lt;/strong&gt; All you have to do is tweet an image of your current dashboard &amp;ldquo;Processed&amp;rdquo; count and say you want Sidekiq Pro. Here&amp;rsquo;s The Clymb&amp;rsquo;s dashboard:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
