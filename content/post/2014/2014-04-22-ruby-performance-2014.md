Last year I posted [a comparison of various Ruby VMs and how fast they could process N empty jobs][1]. This is the equivalent of pumping out "Hello World" responses in an app server: it's not very useful for application developers but it's far more useful than a microbenchmark in determining real Ruby VM performance. Let's take a look at the most popular three versions available today: MRI 2.1.1, MRI 2.0.0 and JRuby 1.7.11.

Time required to process 50,000 empty jobs with a single Sidekiq process running 25 threads.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Version</th>
    <th> Time </th>
    <th> With Logging </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> 2.1.1 </td>
    <td> 46 sec </td>
    <td> 67 sec </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> 2.0.0 </td>
    <td> 50 sec </td>
    <td> 70 sec </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> 1.7.11 </td>
    <td> 33 sec </td>
    <td> 51 sec </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Like last year, JRuby continues to dominate in raw runtime performance. 2.1.1 shows a small performance advantage over 2.0.

"With Logging" shows some interesting data: just logging the start and finish times of the jobs to the global logger proves to be a major performance hit. The reason is that Ruby's Logger contains an internal Mutex to ensure that data is logged to the stream atomically. This Mutex becomes a source of contention when 25 threads are processing those no-op jobs. Your first impression might be to optimize the Logger but this is a red herring! During normal execution the logger won't be as heavily contented because your jobs are actually doing work.

[The actual code is here][2].

Run on a late 2013 MBP retina with 2.8Ghz Core i7 with 2 cores running on battery. Defaults were used for everything.

java version "1.7.0_45"  
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_45-b18)  
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.45-b08, mixed mode)
