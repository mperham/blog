I just released [Inspeqtor][1] 0.7.0 ([changes][2]) with a few awesome new features.  What's new?
<!--more-->

### memory:total\_rss

My main use case for Inspeqtor is monitoring forking app servers with long-living child processes,
e.g. Unicorn or puma, and restarting them if the child processes start to bloat.  Unfortunately this
is a common problem in the Ruby world.  Now you can do this:

```
# /etc/inspeqtor/services.d/myapp_unicorn.inq
check service myapp_unicorn
  # total_rss = the sum of the RSS of the master process + all child processes
  if memory:total_rss > 2g for 4 cycles then restart, alert
```

This was the final missing bit of functionality I required to monitor Ruby on Rails applications; now I can
uninstall Monit!

### Postgresql Metrics

Inspeqtor can now connect to Postgresql instances and pull critical metrics for monitoring.  These
metrics are rather complicated to explain so I will refer you straight to the
[Postgresql wiki documentation](https://github.com/mperham/inspeqtor/wiki/Daemon-Specific-Metrics#postgresql) which
lists each metric, what it means and how it is calculated.  An example is worth 1000 words:

```
# /etc/inspeqtor/services.d/postgresql.inq
check service postgresql with username root, hostname localhost, port 5432
  if memory:rss > 4g then alert
  # verify block cache is effective
  if postgresql:blk_hit_rate < 95% then alert
  # verify total size of data + indexes
  if postgresql:total_size > 10g then alert
  # verify concurrent connection count
  if postgresql:numbackends > 100 then alert
```

### Miscellaneous

@sorentwo contributed `reload` support (you can send HUP to a process if a rule triggers) and several
other bug fixes.  He's also Inspeqtor's first committer, congratulations Parker!

@felixbuenemann contributed unauthenticated SMTP support, for organizations that send mail through
a preconfigured sendmail instance on localhost and several other fixes.

That's 0.7.0 in a nutshell! If you aren't using Inspeqtor yet, [here's how to get started][3].
