I'm pleased to announce my latest venture to support the Ruby open source community: the [Gem Fellowship](https://gem.coop/fellowship).
I want this grant program to support and fund existing Ruby-related open source project maintainers and their ongoing efforts: fixing bugs and adding features for those libraries we know and love.

Early in my Ruby days, I took over maintenance on the [`memcache-client`](https://rubygems.org/gems/memcache-client) gem.
A year later Couchbase asked me if I would be interested in adding support for memcache's new binary protocol; they would be willing to pay me to do the work.
I accepted their offer and that work turned into the `dalli` gem which has benefited the entire Ruby community.
The amount was $3,000, a laughably small amount IMO considering the actual amount of time I spent working on it. 500-1000 hours over the next two years?
But the expertise I developed from that small stipend was absolutely critical to making Sidekiq into the high performance Rubygem which has been so valuable to the Ruby community.
Everybody wins.

That's the spirit in which I've created the Gem Fellowship.
Do you have an idea for a major improvement to something Ruby-related?
Tell us how you'd improve the Ruby ecosystem if someone paid you to do the work.

I'm allocating $100,000 for each of the next three years to fund grants from $2,500 up to $25,000 per project and hope to fund anywhere between 5-20 projects per year.
You can apply using [this application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pyk3z2Qd3Fuwz9xtE_RJP3ricalWTEvvUjzsssbY5cQ/) any time before January 1st.
I'm working with the good people at [gem.coop](https://gem.coop) to select worthy projects; expect notifications to follow in January.
