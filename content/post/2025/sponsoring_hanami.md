I'm happy to announce a [substantial $12,000 grant](https://opencollective.com/hanami) to the [Hanami](https://hanamirb.org) framework.
I've been a massive believer in Open Source software since publishing my first open source project in 1995.
There's nothing more empowering than direct access to the exact source code needed to solve a problem.

But Ruby has a problem: it's mostly a monoculture around Rails.
Merb and Sinatra provided valuable app framework options in the past, I believe we need new options for the future.

That's where I want to put my money where my mouth is.
As the project leader, Tim Riley is preparing to dedicate significantly more time to Hanami, [supported by Ruby businesses](https://opencollective.com/hanami).
I've signed on a major sponsor and I hope other Ruby-based organizations will see the benefit of supporting Tim and Hanami through OpenCollective.

[Hanami 2.2 shipped recently](https://hanamirb.org/blog/2024/11/05/hanami-220/) with database ORM and migration support, including a very interesting advantage:
the "N+1 query" problem is impossible with Hanami's ORM layer. There are no lazy loaded associations, unlike Active Record, which means you never have to worry about a sudden regression in database calls and page performance, a common issue with Rails apps.

Are you building a brand new Ruby app?
