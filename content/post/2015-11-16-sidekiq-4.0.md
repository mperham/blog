## Sidekiq

Sidekiq 4.0 is a major optimization release.  Sidekiq's core has
been redesigned to remove dependencies and now goes down to the [bear metal](http://www.boblee.com/images/bear_guitar.jpg).
Benchmarks show job overhead is reduced **six times**,
garbage creation reduced by **eight times** and job latency cut in half.

**Redis 2.8 or greater is now required**.

There are no public Sidekiq API changes so this version upgrade should be very easy.

Please read the [Sidekiq 4.0 release notes](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/4.0-Upgrade.md) for all the detail.

## Sidekiq Pro

Sidekiq Pro 3.0 is designed to work with Sidekiq 4.0's new core design.
Reliable fetch has been reimplemented but the semantics should remain
identical.  Pausing and unpausing queues now takes effect in real-time
due to the redesign, no more polling or 10 second delay.

Platforms without persistent hostnames, notably Heroku and Docker, get
official support for reliable fetch through the new `ephemeral_hostname` option.

## Sidekiq Enterprise

The newest member of the Sidekiq family, Sidekiq Enterprise, has
solidified over the last three months with a handful of bugs fixed
and almost one hundred customers running it in production.
At this point I think it's stable enough to call 1.0.
As with Sidekiq Pro, some features have been re-implemented
to work with the new Sidekiq 4.0 core.

There are no release notes because there's nothing to note: no new
features and the semantics are identical to 0.x.

## Support

Sidekiq 3.x and Sidekiq Pro 2.x are stable and now in maintenance mode; they will get critical bug fixes
through 2016.

## Conclusion

The demand for both Sidekiq and its commercial siblings continues to amaze me
since I released Sidekiq Pro three years ago.  Today Sidekiq has passed
5 million downloads on Rubygems, Sidekiq Pro has many hundreds of customers and
Sidekiq Enterprise approaches its first hundred.
Thank you to my customers; you make it possible for me to support and work
full-time on Sidekiq.

running in minutes.](http://sidekiq.org)
