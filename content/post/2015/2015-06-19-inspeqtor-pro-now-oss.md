Last year I created Inspeqtor as a fresh take on process monitoring, to improve upon monit and similar tools.  Part of that process was
creating a commercial version, [Inspeqtor Pro][0], to provide long-term viability for the project.  I have little desire to
debate why but Inspeqtor Pro has not sold well enough to continue as is; something has to change.

Today I'm [open sourcing Inspeqtor Pro][2].  It is still not **free** software, you must purchase a license to use it in production,
but being open source means it will be easier and cheaper for me to support via issues and pull requests.  I hope today's leading companies
and developers want their infrastructure open source, this covers both bases: the source is available to inspect plus
licensing and long-term support are easy to purchase.

[Installing Inspeqtor Pro on your Linux server is now dead simple][3].  Try it out - I hope you like it!
