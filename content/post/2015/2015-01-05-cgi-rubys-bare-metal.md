**How simple can you make a web request?**

Happy 2015 everyone!  For 2015, I wanted to spend some time documenting and automating my
business as much as possible.  Ezra Z's and James Golick's recent passing was a reminder to
myself about life: *hope for the best but plan for the worst*.

My biggest technical task was then to automate the onboarding of a new [Sidekiq Pro][1] customer.  If I
pass away next week, I want people to still be able to purchase and renew their subscription
so my wife and child have recurring income they can count on for the next few years.  Essentially
I want to automate day-to-day operations.

My Sidekiq Pro server is as simple as humanly possible: it's running only Apache.  Perfect for serving
static files but how do I handle an arbitrary request?  That's when
I asked myself: **How simple can you make a web request?**  The requirements are straightforward: Stripe
will call my server with a subscription event when someone starts or stops their Sidekiq Pro
subscription.  I need a script to perform the magic to grant/revoke access and send the customer an email
with access details.  This call will only happen a few times a day, max.

This is a perfect case for going down to the [bare metal][2] and using the oldest web technology: [CGI][3].

**Common Gateway Interface**

CGI was the first standard for tying Unix and the Web together.  The Unix programming model says a process
should take input on STDIN and output on STDOUT.  CGI allows a webserver like Apache to call an external
script with the details of a web request as STDIN.  The script then outputs the HTTP response back as STDOUT.
Ruby's `cgi` library will parse the request coming from STDIN and provides some response output helpers
your code can use to generate HTML responses.

In my case, Stripe POSTs a blob of JSON in the request body. Since I'm responding to the Stripe robot, it only
needs to see a 200 OK response &mdash; no fancy view rendering layer required.

{{< highlight ruby >}}
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'json'
require 'cgi'

cgi = CGI.new
# CGI tries to parse the request body as form parameters so a
# blob of JSON awkwardly ends up as the one and only parameter key.
stripe_event = JSON.parse(cgi.params.keys.first)

do_the_magic(stripe_event) # magic happens right here

cgi.out("status" => "OK", "type" => "text/plain", "connection" => "close") do
  "Success"
end
{{< / highlight >}}

I configured Apache to know to execute my CGI script by adding this inside the vhost configuration:

{{< highlight conf >}}
ScriptAlias /stripe/ /opt/stripe/

<Directory /opt/stripe/>
  Require all granted
</Directory>
{{< / highlight >}}

Now if I request `http://server/stripe/event.rb`, Apache will call `/opt/stripe/event.rb`.

Look at what I'm not running: puma or unicorn, rails or sinatra, redis or memcached, postgres or mysql, bundler,
capistrano, etc.
The real thing is using 3-4 gems.  That's it.  The script runs in a few seconds and then exits.  Nothing
to keep running 24/7 and nothing to monitor. Deployment means using `scp` to copy the .rb file to the server.  I
don't even have to restart anything upon deploy because nothing was running in the first place!

## Reality Check

CGI certainly isn't the right solution for every problem: each request starts a new Ruby process so there's a
small bit of overhead but for systems which expect little traffic but require maximum reliability, it's
something worth considering.  There's a higher performance variant of CGI called [FastCGI][4] which
solves the performance overhead by keeping a process running 24/7.

Ultimately plain old CGI solved my requirements: only Apache is running 24/7 and new Sidekiq Pro customers
now get their license information within seconds of purchase, making everyone happy!
