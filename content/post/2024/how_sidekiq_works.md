A few weeks ago, I sat gobsmacked at my laptop reading one of the most impressive technical deep dives I've ever read.
Dan Svetlov wrote a blog post "How does Sidekiq really work?" on [his blog](https://dansvetlov.me) which delved deep into Sidekiq's internals, explaining how it actually works.
The most impressive part of this blog post is that it was 100% accurate.
There were no mistakes or misunderstandings, Dan did the work and shows the receipts.

I was so impressed that I reached out to Dan privately and bought the rights to publish his post.
He learned a ton, taught his readers about Sidekiq and made good money to do so.

If you want to learn more about Ruby infrastructure and background jobs, this is a fantastic resource.
