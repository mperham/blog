Like many people, I've been shaken by the events of the last week.
I was raised to believe in freedom for all, the rule of law and the inalienable rights
guaranteed to all Americans by the Constitution.  But ultimately the law
and the Constitution are pieces of paper; it's up to every one of us to
defend those rights against their erosion.

But what can I do?  Well, a couple of things:

1. Join the millions of others and protest.
2. Donate money to organizations which are defending our rights.
2. Donate my technical tools to those organizations.

# Non-Profit Licensing

I'm offering a **free** license for Sidekiq Enterprise to nation-wide 501(c)3 non-profits
whose mission is to protect our civil rights or the environment.
Please [email me](mailto:mike&#64;contribsys.com) if you are interested.
