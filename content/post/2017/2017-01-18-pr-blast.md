Apologies, dear reader, it's been a while since I blogged; I've been busy with many
things for the last few months:

1. We bought a house and moved, kid started kindergarten.
2. I rewrote Sidekiq Pro's reliable\_fetch into super\_fetch, feedback has been
   quite good with no bugs reported and nice performance
   improvements [noted by the Baremetrics team](https://twitter.com/scottymeuk/status/801828989258108932/).

3. I've pushed out 8 patch releases, trying to stabilize Sidekiq 4.2's
   new Rails 5 support.  Not my finest hour, but on the positive side I wrote an
   integration test suite to verify Sidekiq's job execution
   functionality with Rails 4/5 dev/prod.
4. I attended Rubyconf 2016 in Cincinnati, it was a high-quality conference as usual
   from the Ruby Cental folks.
5. I've done 4-5 different interviews on my business and how it's grown
   over the last few years.

## Business

The last point wasn't really planned but snowballed.  I decided to
interview with IndieHackers on a lark and it turns out that several others
wanted to interview me based on my success so far.

* [IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses/sidekiq)
* [The SaaS Bootstrapper](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tsb004-mike-perham-turning/id1171237328?i=1000377741544&mt=2)
* [Starting and Sustaining](https://medium.com/starting-sustaining/mike-perham-interview-8e98939284a5)
* [Thoughtbot](http://giantrobots.fm/219)

The net takeaway is that Sidekiq sales are going very well, revenue grew
about +75% in 2016, and Sidekiq is now the dominant background solution for Ruby, according to [Infinum's Rubygems analysis](https://infinum.co/the-capsized-eight/analyzing-rubygems-stats-v2016).

## What's Next?

Sidekiq 5.0!
