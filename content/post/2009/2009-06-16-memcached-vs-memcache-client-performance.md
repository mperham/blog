title: memcached vs memcache-client Performance

[memcached][1] is Evan Weaver's Ruby wrapper around the libmemcached C library and widely regarded as quite fast. After an hour of trying, I finally got a build of memcached to actually compile and install on my machine (the trick: you need to download the custom packages Evan links on his blog, nothing else seems to work). Here's the results:

```

```

In most cases, memcache-client is within 33-50% of the performance of memcached. This is amazing for a (mostly) pure Ruby library performing a lot of network IO against a C library which has been tuned for speed! I hope that puts to bed any lingering doubts that memcache-client is slow.

Remember: if you are using Rails 2.3, just "gem install memcache-client" and Rails will pick up the latest version with all these performance improvements.
