Subversion allows you to pull external code into your code by using the svn:externals property. It's pretty simple to use; assume we have a library "foo" which we want to pull into the current directory.Â  This script will add the external reference for you:

```
TMP=current.tmp

svn pg --strict svn:externals > $TMP
echo "$1 $2" >> $TMP
svn ps svn:externals --file $TMP .
rm $TMP
svn up
```

Call it like this:

```
extern foo https://svn.myhost.com/source/libraries/foo
```
