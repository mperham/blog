Rails has a problem: its production logging is somewhat lacking. By default, Rails will emit a bunch of lines for each request, which makes grepping the output tougher than it should be. Look at this, it's nice to look at but painful to aggregate:

```
Started GET "/" for 127.0.0.1 at 2012-03-10 14:28:14 +0100
Processing by HomeController#index as HTML
  Rendered text template within layouts/application (0.0ms)
  Rendered layouts/_assets.html.erb (2.0ms)
  Rendered layouts/_top.html.erb (2.6ms)
  Rendered layouts/_about.html.erb (0.3ms)
  Rendered layouts/_google_analytics.html.erb (0.4ms)
Completed 200 OK in 79ms (Views: 78.8ms | ActiveRecord: 0.0ms)
```

[Lograge][1] 'tames' Rails production logging setup to emit one line per request, a la Apache or nginx. The output is key-value pairs; parsing it into a hash is trivial. Here's some output from [The Clymb][2] production logging with lograge enabled:

```

```

Ah, much cleaner! (and notice the HTTP status value is a float. :-) This format gives us the critical request information required for performance tuning and is easily digestible by simple scripts. Enabling it is trivial:

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb
MyApp::Application.configure do
  config.lograge.enabled = true
end
```

Much happier logs lead to much happier developers. Happy logging! Tomorrow I'll cover a gem (or two!?) designed to make email development happier...
