      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m a big fan of helping and empowering others through my open source software contributions
but I often get pings from people from around the world asking for help.
These requests generally take two forms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;I&#39;m having this problem with your software...&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;I want help with my business idea...&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I&#39;ve learned over time is that &lt;strong&gt;talking to individuals
privately does not scale&lt;/strong&gt;.  You have to arrange a date/time, determine a
chat location/method, often to discuss a problem that can be solved in
3-5 minutes. Often business questions take an hour or more of due
diligence, demand research into a particular vertical, etc.  Here&#39;s the
policies I&#39;ve found work best for all parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;software-issues&#34;&gt;Software Issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All OSS support must go into a persistent, searchable public forum.  No private email, no chat
rooms or IRC, etc.  Persistent means it can be found years from now.
Searchable means anyone can search for their own problem and find
related discussions.  GitHub Issues and StackOverflow are my go-to
solutions here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these traits, users can search and find solutions to their own
problems without bothering you.  This is a very good thing: you&#39;re happy
and they&#39;re happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;business-help&#34;&gt;Business Help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to my notority and success, I&#39;ve found myself emailed more and more
frequently by random people wanting my opinion on various subjects (some
of which I&#39;m definitely not qualified for).  Unlike software support,
there&#39;s no issue tracker for building a business.  Instead I turn to the
example of another profession: college professors.  They have classes
with 100s of students, how do they provide one-on-one help to such a
large group?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They provide &lt;strong&gt;office hours&lt;/strong&gt;.  Students can show up to the professor&#39;s
office at a well-known hour in order to get help.  If other students are
there, they all have to share the professor&#39;s time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the purpose of my weekly &lt;a href=&#34;http://sidekiq.org/support&#34;&gt;Happy Hour&lt;/a&gt;,
anyone can show up for that hour and video chat with me about any
subject.  If others show up, you might have to share the time.  We don&#39;t
have to arrange a time or location, you just need to RSVP so I know to
be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wrapup&#34;&gt;Wrapup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By providing software support in an open, searchable forum and weekly
video chat, I can easily provide support to a large group of random
people &lt;strong&gt;for free&lt;/strong&gt; and still have time for my business, customers and family.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tracking down performance bugs in Sidekiq jobs</title>
      <link>http://www.mikeperham.com/2017/06/05/tracking-down-performance-bugs-in-sidekiq-jobs/</link>

      <description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Sidekiq Enterprise customer recently emailed me to ask for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m having trouble trying to figure out why one particular worker I have takes so long per job. Some of the jobs are taking 30 minutes. What the program does is load a spreadsheet to the database. When I run &amp;quot;top&amp;quot;, it looks like this.  What should my next step be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./images/debugging-top.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;top output&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-explanation&#34;&gt;The Explanation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great question.  The top screenshot tells me a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each process is using ~4GB of RAM, which is a lot, but top also notes
the machine has ~64GB of memory so it&#39;s not necessarily unusual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are four Ruby 2.1 processes (which I assume are Sidekiq
processes), each pegging a core at 100%.  We want to track down what
is causing the CPU to peg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a two step process to get more info:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit the Busy page in the Web UI and see which jobs are running right now.
See a job that&#39;s taking too long?  Note its PID and TID (&amp;quot;13159&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;otqnxjaoc&amp;quot; in the screenshot).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send the TTIN signal to that PID (&lt;code&gt;kill -TTIN 13159&lt;/code&gt;) and find the backtrace associated with that TID in the log output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./images/debugging-busy.png&#34; alt=&#34;busy page&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often the job backtrace will give you the clue you need to solve the performance problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-conclusion&#34;&gt;The Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, the backtrace did provide the necessary clue and the customer did find a solution.
He was creating a job per row in an Excel file but each job had to get the header data from
the Excel file; if there was 1000 rows, he&#39;d create 1000 jobs and &lt;strong&gt;each job would reparse the entire Excel file to get the header info&lt;/strong&gt;.
By restructing the job arguments to include the header info, he removed this redundant work and solved
a problem which had plagued him for months.  Time elapsed: less than an hour!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral of the story: harness the awesome power of Sidekiq&#39;s TTIN feature to crush your performance bugs!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hello Sidekiq 5.0</title>
      <link>http://www.mikeperham.com/2017/04/25/hello-sidekiq-5.0/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2017 09:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <author>Mike Perham</author>
      <guid>http://www.mikeperham.com/2017/04/25/hello-sidekiq-5.0/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;figure style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;
 &lt;img src=&#34;http://www.mikeperham.com/images/50.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few months of work, I&#39;m happy to announce that Sidekiq 5.0 is
now available.  Sidekiq 5.0 refactors the core job processor to work better
with Rails 5 and includes a few breaking changes that have been pending for a
while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-s-new&#34;&gt;What&#39;s New?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rails-5-native&#34;&gt;Rails 5 native!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidekiq::Processor has been redesigned to work well
with Rails 5.0&#39;s Executor.  The Executor is a new API which needs
to wrap any use of Rails code; it automatically handles code reloading,
database connection management and any other callbacks.  Before now,
Sidekiq had middleware to clean up database connections but
this is no longer necessary with the Executor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that Sidekiq 5.0 will still work with Rails 4.0+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bad-json-no-problem&#34;&gt;Bad JSON, no problem!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidekiq now explicitly handles malformed job payloads which cannot be
parsed as valid JSON.  This is usually due to pushing jobs to Redis via
other languages.  Invalid jobs are immediately sent to the Dead set so
they can be manually examined.  Previously these payloads were discarded
or needed to be removed from Redis manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;right-to-left-languages&#34;&gt;Right-to-Left Languages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.mikeperham.com/images/bidi.png&#34; alt=&#34;bidi&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Web UI can now natively render RTL (right-to-left) languages like
Arabic, Hebrew, Persian and Urdu.  This brings language support from 21
to 25 languages and another billion or so potential Sidekiq users!
Change your browser to request one of those languages
and the Web UI will render in that language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cleanup&#34;&gt;Cleanup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;delay&lt;/code&gt; APIs are now disabled by default, since they pollute
&lt;code&gt;Class&lt;/code&gt; and can lead to overly large job payloads.  You can re-enable
them if your application uses that API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quiet signal has been changed from USR1 to TSTP, which is available in JRuby
and better reflects the intent: Threads SToP.  USR1 will still work but is
deprecated. Sidekiq 4.2.9+ also supports TSTP so you can port your
deployment scripts to use the new signal without risking a major version bump
at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for Ruby 2.0, Ruby 2.1 and Rails 3.2 is dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/5.0-Upgrade.md&#34;&gt;5.0 upgrade notes&lt;/a&gt; for more detail and how to upgrade safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you to all my &lt;a href=&#34;http://sidekiq.org&#34;&gt;Sidekiq Pro and Sidekiq Enterprise&lt;/a&gt; customers for
ensuring the long-term support and maintenance of Sidekiq.  Support OSS software
and your infrastructure vendors so we can support you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sidekiq at Railsconf 2017</title>
      <link>http://www.mikeperham.com/2017/04/24/sidekiq-at-railsconf-2017/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Every year I attend Rubyconf and Railsconf and this year is no
different.  I launched Sidekiq 4.0 at Rubyconf 2015 and now I&#39;m excited
 to get down to Phoenix and launch Sidekiq 5.0!
I want to meet any Rubyists, new or old, who want to chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://railsconf.com/assets/objects/RailsconfInternal@2x-2c15a28ee162c7f9151c2148adaeccfeb2786fdb748a4f8b3a948a3b1e705d57.png&#34; alt=&#34;Railsconf&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-personal-note&#34;&gt;A Personal Note&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attended my first conference in 2007, Rubyconf, in Charlotte NC.
I still remember my mental state: &lt;strong&gt;awkwardness, isolation and loneliness
because I knew about two people there&lt;/strong&gt;.  By nature I&#39;m an introvert and
not really good at mingling in crowds (one reason booze is so popular
at conferences: it can decrease your inhibitions and make you more chatty).
As my reputation increased in the community, going to conferences became
easier because people knew me but here&#39;s my dirty secret:
I&#39;m still awkward and not great at socializing with new people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have a guarantee: if you don&#39;t know anyone at Railsconf or just
need someone to talk to, find me and say hello.  The first day I always
wear a Sidekiq t-shirt.  You know my blog and here&#39;s some
topics I will talk endlessly about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You and your Ruby story&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance and scalability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threading vs Evented design in languages and systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sidekiq and other background job systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruby, Crystal and Go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Source, Sustainability, and Business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soccer, Motorcycles and Sports Cars (ask me about the time I crashed a
race car at Laguna Seca!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also quite likely that you know my name but I don&#39;t know yours and
I&#39;m terrible with names/faces so &lt;strong&gt;please introduce yourself&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS And of course, I&#39;m giving away Sidekiq stickers to anyone who asks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Monitoring Redis</title>
      <link>http://www.mikeperham.com/2017/04/20/monitoring-redis/</link>

&lt;figure style=&#34;float: right; padding-left: 50px&#34;&gt;
 &lt;img src=&#34;./images/redis.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redis is widely by the Ruby community but, like any complex piece of
infrastructure, isn&#39;t well understood by many of its users.  I wanted to
write a blog post that would answer the question: &lt;strong&gt;How can I check on
the health of my Redis server?&lt;/strong&gt;  Here&#39;s a few things you can do to
better understand your Redis server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ask-for-info&#34;&gt;Ask for Info&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;info&lt;/code&gt; command is the easiest way to get an overall view of Redis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ redis-cli info

db8:keys=4,expires=2,avg_ttl=4423347833
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(output trimmed a bit)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a few very important pieces to note in the output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;config_file&lt;/code&gt; shows where Redis is getting its static configuration.
If you need to tweak a setting, this is where to go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;connected_clients&lt;/code&gt; shows how many network client connections are
currently connected.  It&#39;s normal for this to be in the hundreds or
even thousands for a very busy server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;used_memory_*&lt;/code&gt; is important to see how much RAM is used by Redis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory is the most important thing to note here.  Your entire dataset
size &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; fit into machine RAM.  If it does not, the resulting swapping will lead
to terrible performance and massive latency spikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;redis-cli --stat&lt;/code&gt; will give you the most important details in a real-time view
you can watch or scrape:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ redis-cli --stat
------- data ------ --------------------- load -------------------- - child -
keys       mem      clients blocked requests            connections
31         1009.00K 1       0       681483 (+0)         576
31         1009.00K 1       0       681484 (+1)         576
31         1009.00K 1       0       681485 (+1)         576
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;redis-cli&lt;/code&gt; is a very powerful tool with lots of nice features within
it.  It&#39;s worth running &lt;code&gt;--help&lt;/code&gt; and playing with the various options
and modes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;look-out-for-latency&#34;&gt;Look out for Latency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latency is the time difference between request and response, e.g. the client sends a
command and gets a result back in 10ms.  We want this round trip to be as fast as
possible.
Really bad latency can trigger &amp;quot;Operation timed out&amp;quot; exceptions in your application.
There are two general latency sources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network - the network between the client and Redis can be congested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal - Redis itself might have commands or internal operations
which add significant latency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;network&#34;&gt;Network&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the current network latency easily:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ redis-cli --latency
min: 0, max: 1, avg: 0.29 (632 samples)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows a minimum of 0ms and max of 1ms, averaging 290µs, latency to
my localhost server.  Ideal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also easily watch latency history, here with a default window of 15 sec:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ redis-cli --latency-history
min: 0, max: 7, avg: 0.24 (1321 samples) -- 15.00 seconds range
min: 0, max: 256, avg: 0.55 (1280 samples) -- 15.01 seconds range
min: 0, max: 3062, avg: 3.86 (1051 samples) -- 15.98 seconds range
min: 0, max: 490, avg: 0.69 (1255 samples) -- 15.01 seconds range
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the first window looks pretty good, the second window had a
spike of 256ms, and the third had a spike of 3062ms (ouch!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I triggered these spikes by running &lt;code&gt;redis-cli debug sleep 0.5&lt;/code&gt;.  Not
recommended in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;internal&#34;&gt;Internal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redis also has a latency event and monitoring subsystem to track
commands execution latency and operations (like forking) which might
block command processing. Use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor&#34;&gt;LATENCY&lt;/a&gt;
commands to monitor and collect these events.  Some commands can be naturally
slow, see SLOWLOG below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;watch-for-slow-commands&#34;&gt;Watch for Slow Commands&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it is single-threaded, it&#39;s vitally important that all commands
to Redis process quickly or one slow command can block everyone else for
a significant amount of time.  Redis includes a configurable &lt;a href=&#34;https://redis.io/commands/slowlog&#34;&gt;SLOWLOG&lt;/a&gt;
command to watch for these bad apples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Redis is configured by Homebrew to log any commands that take longer than 10ms, a
sensible default.  Run this on your instance and see if you find anything suspicious:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ redis-cli slowlog get 10
1) 1) (integer) 3
   2) (integer) 1492461257
   3) (integer) 11825
   4)  1) &amp;quot;LPUSH&amp;quot;
       2) &amp;quot;queue:default&amp;quot;

(34 more bytes)&amp;quot;
      [snip]
      32) &amp;quot;... (9971 more arguments)&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four parts to each entry: 3 is a unique identifier, 1492461257 is the timestamp
when it happened and 11825 is the number of microseconds for execution, 11.825ms.
The last part is the command with arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I happen to know that entry is an LPUSH to the &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; queue of 10,000 jobs.  It&#39;s
a testcase for Sidekiq::Client&#39;s &lt;code&gt;push_bulk&lt;/code&gt; API.  Since we&#39;re
enqueueing 10,000 jobs at once, it&#39;s not surprising that might take almost 12ms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is safe to run SLOWLOG in production and highly encouraged.&lt;/strong&gt;  In
fact, I would play with &lt;code&gt;slowlog-log-slower-than&lt;/code&gt; values until you find
a setting that catches unexpectedly slow things but does not contain a
lot of &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; commands from your application.
If you find the slowlog is constantly full, &lt;strong&gt;redesign your system so it
doesn&#39;t run those slow commands&lt;/strong&gt;.
  For instance, if you want to enqueue
10,000 jobs, perhaps you could call &lt;code&gt;push_bulk&lt;/code&gt; 10 times with 1000 jobs
each, so each invocation only takes 1/10th as long.
If a piece of OSS is running a slow comamnd,
open an issue so the maintainer knows about the problem.  I&#39;m not too
proud to admit it&#39;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/3332&#34;&gt;happened&lt;/a&gt;
several times with Sidekiq; I fix them as fast as I can!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;extra-credit&#34;&gt;Extra Credit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was managing technical operations, my team was
responsible for monitoring our infrastructure.  We would do things like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a cron job to dump the slowlog to a daily email if it is not empty.
Treat any entries as issues to be investigated and fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up a dashboard for the Redis server.  Have dedicated
graphs for &lt;code&gt;connected_clients&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;instantaneous_ops_per_sec&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;used_memory_rss&lt;/code&gt;.
Treat big changes in these graphs as incidents to be investigated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of owning your infrastructure is monitoring its health proactively;
understanding these tools and having quick access to this data will be
invaluable when debugging failures and outages.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Migrating from redis-namespace</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In a blog post in 2015, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mikeperham.com/2015/09/24/storing-data-with-redis/&#34;&gt;Storing Data with Redis&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote about your options for partitioning data
stored within Redis and came down pretty hard on using key namespacing
via redis-namespace.
The redis-namespace gem allows you to share a Redis database among several
applications by prefixing every key with a namespace but it&#39;s a terrible hack
that no one should use.  Redis
already has a native solution if you want to share a Redis instance: databases.
The default database is 0.  Here&#39;s how to point Sidekiq to use database
1 instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #272822&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;Sidekiq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;configure_client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color: #75715e&#34;&gt;# these are equivalent&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;redis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;redis://localhost:6379/1&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;redis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, Redis offers 16 databases: 0-15.  This is configurable in
redis.conf.  Keys in one database are not visible from another database.
All databases will share global data like registered Lua scripts.
In practice that&#39;s not a big deal due to Redis&#39;s excellent implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have multiple apps and want to share a Redis instance, just have
them use different databases.  Create a convention for how your apps map to
database indexes and stick with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache data, job data and transactional/persistent data have different configuration needs and should
not share a Redis instance at all.  If you use Redis for caching and
jobs and your budget is &amp;gt;$0, you should have two different Redis instances
with different configurations. Job data is closer to transactional data,
they can probably share the same Redis if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Our current application uses redis-namespace.  How do we migrate away from namespace usage without losing everything we have currently?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, this is possible but non-trivial, as with all data migrations.
I will assume you are running Sidekiq.
Continue onward for the nittiest of gritty, dear reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;migrating-your-data&#34;&gt;Migrating your Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any data migration, you have two choices:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run old/new systems in parallel for N days/weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shutdown old setup, migrate data, start new setup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;running-old-new-in-parallel&#34;&gt;Running old/new in parallel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to start two Sidekiq processes: old and new.  The old
process(es) will continue to process any retries and scheduled jobs in
the old data.  The new process(es) will process all new jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Starting an old and new process
OLD=1 bundle exec sidekiq ...
bundle exec sidekiq ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We specifically want the client configuration to only point to the new
system so that any new jobs from Puma/Unicorn/etc will go to the new
system.  In this example, the old Redis is using the &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; namespace in
database 0.  We want the new system to use database 1 with no namespace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #272822&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #75715e&#34;&gt;# Note that the client ALWAYS pushes to the new process&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;Sidekiq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;configure_client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;redis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;Sidekiq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;configure_server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;OLD&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color: #75715e&#34;&gt;# We&amp;#39;ll continue to poll for old scheduled jobs and retries&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;redis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;redis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a Sidekiq Pro customer you can monitor both old and new in the Web UI with Sidekiq Pro&#39;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Pro-Web-UI#sharding&#34;&gt;Web UI Sharding support&lt;/a&gt;,
just mount a copy for the old and new config in your &lt;code&gt;config/routes.rb&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #272822&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;NEWPOOL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;ConnectionPool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;Redis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;new(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;OLDPOOL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;ConnectionPool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;Redis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;Namespace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;new(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;:foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;:redis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;Redis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;new(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;mount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;Sidekiq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;Pro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;Web&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;with(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;redis_pool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;NEWPOOL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;/sidekiqnew&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;sidekiqnew&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;mount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;Sidekiq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;Pro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;Web&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;with(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;redis_pool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;OLDPOOL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;/sidekiqold&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;sidekiqold&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monitor your retry and scheduled job counts in the old system.  After N weeks, you should be able to safely decommission the old Sidekiqs.  Ciao, bella!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-big-migration&#34;&gt;The big migration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can afford the downtime, it can be a lot faster/easier/cheaper to simply
migrate your Redis data to strip off the namespace from the key.  You
shut down the old processes (&lt;strong&gt;anything&lt;/strong&gt; that talks to Redis with the namespace),
run the migration script, and start everything with the new setup once it&#39;s complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long will it take?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent question, look at the size of your databases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ redis-cli info
[snip]

# Keyspace
db0:keys=2,expires=0,avg_ttl=0
db4:keys=18,expires=15,avg_ttl=1894990352
db5:keys=10,expires=7,avg_ttl=1894990303
db14:keys=7,expires=4,avg_ttl=1894990402
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the keys count.  This will tell you the magnitude of your
problem: do you have thousands of keys or millions?  For every single
key, we want to strip the namespace from the front of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll write a Lua script which will run atomically on our instance and
rename every key.  &lt;strong&gt;This script will not move the data from database 0
to database 1&lt;/strong&gt; (for future readers, in Redis 4.0, there is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://redis.io/commands/swapdb&#34;&gt;SWAPDB&lt;/a&gt; command which can do
this).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING: Depending on the amount of data in Redis, this script may
crush your Redis instance for a long time.  Do not use it while other
things are using that Redis instance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #272822&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #75715e&#34;&gt;# remove_ns.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;  for _, keyname in pairs(keys) do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;    redis.call(&amp;quot;rename&amp;quot;, keyname, string.sub(keyname, ARGV[2]))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;    count = count + 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;  end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;  return count&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;LUA&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;redis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;eval(script,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;ns,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;ns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Complete, migrated #{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;} keys in #{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;} sec&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shut down everything talking to your Redis instance.&lt;/strong&gt; You can verify
by running &lt;code&gt;redis-cli monitor&lt;/code&gt; against the instance and seeing that
nothing is coming over the wire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;ruby remove_ns.rb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploy your new configuration and start everything back up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;testing&#34;&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a script which creates 500 plain keys and 500 namespaced keys
to verify that 500 keys are migrated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #272822&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;gem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;redis&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt; 4&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;redis&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;redis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;Redis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;new(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #ae81ff&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&#34;color: #ae81ff&#34;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;times&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;redis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;set(idx,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;idx)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;redis-namespace&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;rn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;Redis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;Namespace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;new(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;:foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;redis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;redis)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&#34;color: #ae81ff&#34;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;times&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;rn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;set(idx,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;idx)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #272822&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ ruby remove_ns.rb
Complete, migrated &lt;span style=&#34;color: #ae81ff&#34;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt; keys in &lt;span style=&#34;color: #ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.003167 sec
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The keyspace count goes from 1000 to 500 with the migration.  Please
note that this migration script blindly renames keys so if you have keys named
&amp;quot;foo:bar&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;, it&#39;s possible the latter will be overwritten in the
migration due to the rename.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid namespaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data migrations are always fraught with peril, test in staging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make backups and always have a replica handy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;A user recently submitted a Farsi translation for the Sidekiq
Web UI and I quickly merged it, happy to see another language supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unfortunately, as you know, no good deed goes unpunished.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quickly learned that the Farsi language uses an RTL script - it is
written from right to left.  Like a written page, webapps displaying
Farsi text should be flipped so they are RTL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Webapps that can dynamically change text direction are called
bi-directional, or BiDi.  As you might imagine BiDi support isn&#39;t
trivial but can be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My i18n goal with the Sidekiq Web UI is simple: be as inclusive as
reasonably possible.  I can&#39;t speak any languages fluently except English
but our open source community has developers that speak hundreds
of languages and can help in the effort. I&#39;m proud that the Web UI supports
20+ LTR languages today but it pains me that I can&#39;t support Farsi, Hebrew,
Arabic and other RTL languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/3381&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Until now!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Here&#39;s what I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-flip-that-css&#34;&gt;1. Flip that CSS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a number of automated tools for scanning CSS files and outputing
flipped rules to be used when emitting RTL pages.  These rules will override
your standard LTR rules: where you specify padding-left, you want
padding-right, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It helped a lot that I&#39;ve kept the UI to one simple CSS file, with no
additional tooling or build process.  Bootstrap 3.x is popular enough that
other people have created flipped overrides for it already.  The only hard
work was creating application-rtl.css.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normal CSS, application.css:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #272822&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #a6e22e&#34;&gt;someclass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;margin-left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #ae81ff&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flipped CSS, application-rtl.css:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #272822&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #a6e22e&#34;&gt;someclass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;margin-right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #ae81ff&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-fix-up-the-generated-css&#34;&gt;2. Fix up the Generated CSS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it&#39;s not that easy; you&#39;ll note that now we have a
margin on &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; sides when rendering RTL.  What I had to do was go
through the generated application-rtl.css and update the rules to make
them true overrides, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #272822&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #a6e22e&#34;&gt;someclass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;margin-right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #ae81ff&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;margin-left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;unset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidekiq&#39;s Web UI doesn&#39;t have a huge amount of CSS.  It took me less
than an hour to go through 1000 lines, one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-include-the-right-css&#34;&gt;3. Include the right CSS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you include your application.css as normal and optionally include
the RTL overrides if rendering an RTL script.  For example, I put this RTL logic in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #272822&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #a6e22e&#34;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;%= root_path %&amp;gt;stylesheets/bootstrap.css&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #a6e22e&#34;&gt;media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;screen&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #a6e22e&#34;&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #a6e22e&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;text/css&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #960050; background-color: #1e0010&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;% if rtl? %&amp;gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #a6e22e&#34;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;%= root_path %&amp;gt;stylesheets/bootstrap-rtl.min.css&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #a6e22e&#34;&gt;media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;screen&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #a6e22e&#34;&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #a6e22e&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;text/css&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #960050; background-color: #1e0010&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;% end %&amp;gt;

&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #a6e22e&#34;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;%= root_path %&amp;gt;stylesheets/application.css&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #a6e22e&#34;&gt;media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;screen&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #a6e22e&#34;&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #a6e22e&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;text/css&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #960050; background-color: #1e0010&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;% if rtl? %&amp;gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #a6e22e&#34;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;%= root_path %&amp;gt;stylesheets/application-rtl.css&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #a6e22e&#34;&gt;media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;screen&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #a6e22e&#34;&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #a6e22e&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;text/css&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #960050; background-color: #1e0010&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;% end %&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;rtl?&lt;/code&gt; method is very simple, it just checks for Farsi as the
current locale:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #272822&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #a6e22e&#34;&gt;rtl?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color: #e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;fa&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f92672&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;locale&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result (still buggy, note graph axis labels, but usable):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;640&#34; src=&#34;http://www.mikeperham.com/images/issue3381.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;standards&#34;&gt;Standards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some upcoming standards on the horizon for easier BiDi
support in CSS so you wouldn&#39;t need overrides at all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #272822&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #a6e22e&#34;&gt;someclass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;margin-inline-start:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #ae81ff&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #66d9ef&#34;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #f8f8f2&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;inline-start&lt;/code&gt; maps to &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt; in RTL and &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; in LTR.  Unfortunately
only Firefox supports this syntax today or I could have just updated
application.css directly.  I hope the other browser vendors can
implement this soon as it greatly eases the burden of BiDi support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an extremely brief overview of what I had to do.  Thirty minutes
of reading blog posts taught me a LOT about this subject.  Here&#39;s a few
links with more detail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/09/building-rtl-aware-web-apps-and-websites-part-1/&#34;&gt;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/09/building-rtl-aware-web-apps-and-websites-part-1/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/10/building-rtl-aware-web-apps-websites-part-2/&#34;&gt;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/10/building-rtl-aware-web-apps-websites-part-2/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve learned after 20 years in the industry that i18n and l10n support
is fractal: there is always more complexity that causes problems (date
and number formatting, pluralization rules and text direction are just three
examples) but I make the effort so that more people can use Sidekiq
comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This BiDi work will be part of Sidekiq 5.0.&lt;/strong&gt; If you see a problem in your
own language/locale, please open an issue or send a pull request to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m trying out a new blogging system after using Jekyll for a few
years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-little-history&#34;&gt;A Little History&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been blogging personally since 2003 or so and professionally since
2007 (when I started my Ruby career).  I started on a self-hosted
Movable Type install and migrated to self-hosted Wordpress in ~2009 but
the administrivia and complexities of those systems wore me down.  I
made the decision to wind down my own server and move to hosted
services, like GitHub Pages, after hearing about the hundredth
Wordpress security breach.  Since Ruby is my jam, I
selected Jekyll, a static site generator written in Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;jekyll&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://jekyllrb.com/&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; was a refreshing change because everything is flat files and
static content.  No SQL database of content, no server to administer.
For setup, you have a Gemfile with the &lt;code&gt;github-pages&lt;/code&gt; gem in it and
everything is installed for you by Bundler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All is not perfect though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that one gem requires &lt;strong&gt;74&lt;/strong&gt; dependent gems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could not figure out an easy workflow for creating a post, seeing
it while I authored it despite reading the docs many times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It took 5-6 seconds to rebuild my site everytime I wanted to preview
a content change, incremental builds did not work for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hugo&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;img img-responsive pull-right&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; src=&#34;https://gohugo.io/img/hugo.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; is a static site generator written in Go which solves many of those
problems.  Things I love so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy install with one 17MB binary by running &lt;code&gt;brew install hugo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast: complete site build takes 300ms by running &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can preview my entire site by running &lt;code&gt;hugo server&lt;/code&gt; and livereload just magically works: I can see content changes
immediately in the browser, without even needing to hit the refresh
button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things I don&#39;t like or I&#39;m worried about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of open issues/PRs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large Go codebase, Go is not a terse language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overly complex: archtetypes, taxonomies, tags are all things I don&#39;t need.
Instead of choosing one config format, they support three!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll see how the project continues over the next few years.
I&#39;d love to see a site generator written in Crystal, a fast, higher-level language
that has most of the advantages of Go while also being more terse.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Five Years</title>
      <link>http://www.mikeperham.com/2017/02/06/five-years/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Five years ago, I published v0.5.0 of &lt;a href=&#34;http://sidekiq.org&#34;&gt;a little project&lt;/a&gt; I had great hopes for.
Here we are five years later: I&#39;ve gone from selling $50 licenses to negotiating five-figure enterprise
deals with the Fortune 500.  Five five five!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;gimme-five&#34;&gt;Gimme Five!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./images/highfive.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;five&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;by-the-numbers&#34;&gt;By The Numbers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;style&gt;
table {
  border-collapse: separate;
  border-spacing: 0;
  border: 1px solid #000;
}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;th, td, caption {
  border: 1px solid #000;
  padding: 0.3em;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;table width=&#34;100%&#34;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;1st Birthday&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;2nd Birthday&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;4th Birthday&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;5th Birthday&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Downloads&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;214,300&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1,192,259&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5,505,145&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11,260,039&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Stars&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;2144&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3535&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5846&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;7087&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Closed
Issues&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;663&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1420&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1887&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2378&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Forks&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;266&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;563&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1003&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1247&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Closed PRs&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;228&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;380&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;836&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;938&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Versions&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;44&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;74&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;110&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;127&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Customers&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;200&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;675&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;726&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Employees&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;2016-year-in-review&#34;&gt;2016 Year in Review&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sidekiq

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rails 5.0 support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropped Sinatra dependency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16 bug fix releases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sidekiq Pro

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;timed_fetch and super_fetch algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;17 bug fix releases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sidekiq Enterprise

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Job data encryption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-Process with memory monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web UI authorization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;you-want-five&#34;&gt;You Want Five?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/3301&#34;&gt;Sidekiq 5.0 beta&lt;/a&gt; is now
ready for testing in non-production environments.  The internals have
been redesigned to work better with Rails 5.0.  It no longer supports
older Rubies: Ruby 2.2.2+ only.  Read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/5-0/5.0-Upgrade.md&#34;&gt;upgrade notes&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem &#39;sidekiq&#39;, &#39;5.0.0.beta1&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still believe Ruby is the most fun, most flexible, highest level language
out there for building business applications and Sidekiq is the best
framework for processing business transactions.  The two are a potent
combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s to another great five years!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What can I do?</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Like many people, I&#39;ve been shaken by the events of the last week.
I was raised to believe in freedom for all, the rule of law and the inalienable rights
guaranteed to all Americans by the Constitution.  But ultimately the law
and the Constitution are pieces of paper; it&#39;s up to every one of us to
defend those rights against their erosion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what can I do?  Well, a couple of things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join the millions of others and protest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donate money to organizations which are defending our rights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donate my technical tools to those organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;non-profit-licensing&#34;&gt;Non-Profit Licensing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m offering a &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; license for Sidekiq Enterprise to nation-wide 501(c)3 non-profits
whose mission is to protect our civil rights or the environment.
Please &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:mike&amp;amp;#64;contribsys.com&#34;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;
